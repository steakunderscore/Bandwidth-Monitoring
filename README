Bandwidth-Monitoring
====================

This project has been put on hold until the end of the university year, when I will have more time.

This small python program monitors and logs iptables via ssh. Used to record traffic use over wrt54gl router.


How to use
----------

Set up iptables with 'act' table and correct return table on you router.
Then run main.py to log the data passing through the act table.
